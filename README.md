# Dependable-Software-System
I developed an application of Stable Priority queue implementation in Java. To make this application a dependable software, I used conceptual techniques like Mathematical Formalism is developing blueprints of the system, Continuous Verification and testing, Cleanroom software methodology etc. I made use of Static Analysis Tools like Findbugs to find bugs in the system in the prior stages, before it reaches a critical stage. Emma was used to generate reports on the quality of the system and check the coding standards of the program. Finally, I wrote JUnits for every functional module, to test its reachability and coverage for various test cases.
